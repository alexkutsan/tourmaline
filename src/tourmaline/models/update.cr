    # The update‘s unique identifier. Update identifiers start from a certain
    # positive number and increase sequentially. This ID becomes especially
    # handy if you’re using Webhooks, since it allows you to ignore
    # repeated updates or to restore the correct update sequence,
    # should they get out of order. If there are no new updates
    # for at least a week, then identifier of the next update
    # will be chosen randomly instead of sequentially.

    # which are sent by the bot
    getter poll : Poll?

    # Optional. A user changed their answer in a non-anonymous poll. Bots receive new
    # votes only in polls that were sent by the bot itself.

    # update is received only when the bot is blocked or unblocked by the user.

    # allowed_updates to receive these updates.
